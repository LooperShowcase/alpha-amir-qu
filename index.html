        Childhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen sought to make a business
        using their skills in computer programming.[17] In 1972, they founded
        Traf-O-Data, which sold a rudimentary computer to track and analyze
        automobile traffic data. Gates enrolled at Harvard University while
        Allen pursued a degree in computer science at Washington State
        University, though he later dropped out to work at Honeywell.[18] The
        January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics featured Micro
        Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems's (MITS) Altair 8800
        microcomputer,[19] which inspired Allen to suggest that they could
        program a BASIC interpreter for the device. Gates called MITS and
        claimed that he had a working interpreter, and MITS requested a
        demonstration. Allen worked on a simulator for the Altair while Gates
        developed the interpreter, and it worked flawlessly when they
        demonstrated it to MITS in March 1975 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. MITS
        agreed to distribute it, marketing it as Altair
        BASIC.[16]: 108, 112–114  Gates and Allen established Microsoft on
        April 4, 1975, with Gates as CEO, and Allen suggested the name
        "Micro-Soft", short for micro-computer software.In August 1977, the
        company formed an agreement with ASCII Magazine in Japan, resulting in
        its first international office of ASCII Microsoft. Microsoft moved its
        headquarters to Bellevue, Washington, in January 1979.
